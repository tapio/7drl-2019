Pour Me More
============

A mobile-friendly roguelike-like / roguelite for the 2019 [7DRL Challenge](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Seven_Day_Roguelike_Challenge).

You play as a bartender in a small watering hole, serving patrons beer and other stuff.
If you do your job well, you might get a promotion to a more respectable establishment.

You can play solo, or enlist a friend for cooperative online multiplayer experience!
